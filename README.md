# Logistic-Regression

This Project is used to determine whether a person is having a heart disease condition based on several factors and how we can predict that whether that person is having a heart condition or not.

There is a target variable available which we will be using, and since there is a target variable it is SUPERVISED LEARNING and hence we are using logistic regression for prediction purpose.

I have done some exploratory Data Analysis on the Farmingham dataset to find the relationship between the variables.

Then I've used confusion matrix and classification report to find out the accuracy of our prediction.
